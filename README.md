Submitted as part of the Web Platform Development 2 module by: Christopher Campbell, James Hall and Heather Reid


## Coursework Requirements

Design and implement a milestone planner application. A milestone planner contains a list of
milestones that you are planning to carry out for your coursework project. The application allows the
user to define his or her own milestones, which are only visible to the user.

Main application features:

- A description of the milestone,

- An intended due date and

- The actual completion date.

- Milestones can be removed from the list.

- Milestones can be edited.

- A milestone (list) can be shared with friends using a link.
